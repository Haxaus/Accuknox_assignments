Question: By default are django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance.
 Yes ,By default it executes synchronously but in django 5 can be change to asynchronously.
================================================================
Q1->                                                                                         
        myapp->
                  models.py(Code is there)
  in terminal Run -python manage.py shell
                  -from myapp.models import Model1
                  -Model1.objects.create(name="any_name")
  ===============================================================
                      Output:
                    Signal received!
                    start at: time at which object start to create
                    when obj.save() will run then signal triggers 
                    after waiting for 5 seconds in signals it will process rest process(Showing sychronus behaviour)
                    Signal handler finished processing
                    end at: time at which whole process end takes 5 seconds due to delay
